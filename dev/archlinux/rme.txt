This is how you develop the patch if you're running in Arch Linux.

In a dir that you choose (not current dir), say:
$ mkdir ~/foo
$ cd ~/foo
do either of the following two:
$ pkgctl repo clone --protocol=https firefox-developer-edition
or:
$ git clone https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/firefox-developer-edition.git
(^ untested)

then:
$ cd firefox-developer-edition

was tested with:
commit 95329c97e306e04a379e32ec85f996560a3d4a42 (HEAD -> main, tag: 137.0b10-1, origin/main, origin/HEAD)

so optionally do:
$ git checkout 95329c97e306e04a379e32ec85f996560a3d4a42

then copy the contents of the current repo dir's ./firefox-developer-edition/* into that ~/foo/firefox-developer-edition/ dir, overwrite if it's same checkout, else look for diffs and carry over only what's needed.

then do the modifications for the building:
$ patch -p1 -i ./mod.patch

then run this to extract and prepare the firefox source:
$ ./go_first_time_extract_and_prep

then build or (re)compile firefox:
$ ./go

then run what you've compiled:
$ ./run
